superCrow + Carter's Delay

select your input and output devices on lines 9 & 10. Then connect crow to your computer via usb and run the same way you would superCrow or Carter's Delay, by moving your cursor behind the opening parenthesis on line 1 and hitting ctrl+enter (or cmd+enter on macOS). For extra fun, run your modular's audio output into a usb audio interface connected to your computer!
